## HOMEPAGE — Sezione per sezione

---

### 1. HERO

**Layout:** Testo a sinistra, immagine/foto a destra (o full-width senza foto per ora)

**Headline (grande, bold, bianco):**
```
Your company grew.
Your structure didn't.
```

**Sub-copy (grigio chiaro, sotto headline):**
```
Every founder hits the same wall. You went from 10 to 40 people,
but every decision still runs through you. I fix that.
```

**Credibility line (più piccolo):**
```
I've done this 5 times. Alibaba, ProntoPro, ShopFully. Let me save you 12 months of chaos.
```

**2 CTA buttons:**
- [Book 20 Min with Me] → rosso/accent, link a Calendly
- [See How I Work] → outline/ghost button, ancora alla sezione 3S Method

**Logo bar sotto (grigio, piccolo):**
```
Not my first rodeo. I've worked with:
[Alibaba Group]  [ProntoPro]  [ShopFully]  [Deloitte]  [EY]
```
> Nota: usare testo o loghi semplificati in grigio su sfondo scuro

---

### 2. THE PROBLEM (il founder si riconosce)

**Headline (grande, centrato):**
```
You've built something real. Maybe it's growing fast.
But you have no repeatable way to scale without breaking.
```
> Nota: "repeatable" in font corsivo/accent come fa Judie con "repeatable"

**"Right now:" (bullet list a sinistra, illustrazione/icona a destra)**
```
Right now:
• You're still in the middle of most operational decisions
• Every week feels like putting out fires
• You hired more people but you're working more, not less
• Teams are busy but growth doesn't follow
• Problems between teams become personal instead of structural
```

**Closing line (bold):**
```
You don't need another consultant with a slide deck.
You need someone who's built this before and knows what actually works.
```

**Kicker (bold):**
```
No more guessing why growth stalled while your team doubles.
```

---

### 3. THREE WAYS I CAN HELP (card con icone)

**Headline (grande, centrato):**
```
Here are 3 ways I can help you
```

**Sub-copy:**
```
They all work together to make your company scalable.
```

**3 card (sfondo leggermente più chiaro del background, bordo sottile):**

**Card 1 — icona: struttura/org chart**
```
To fix your structure
```
```
Your org chart says one thing. Reality says another. Roles overlap,
nobody fully owns the outcome, and decisions stall because everything
goes through you. I redesign who owns what so the company actually
runs without you in the middle.
```

**Card 2 — icona: ingranaggi/sistemi**
```
To install real systems
```
```
You've been growing on momentum and duct tape. That works at 10 people.
At 30, it breaks. I build the governance, processes, and accountability
systems that let you scale without adding complexity every time you
add a person.
```

**Card 3 — icona: scudo/protezione**
```
To stop losing margin
```
```
Value leaks in the handoffs between teams that don't talk to each other.
Marketing generates, sales closes, but nobody owns the full cycle.
I find where margin disappears and fix the interfaces. Not theory — numbers.
```

---

### 4. YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE IF...

**Headline (grande, centrato, su sfondo leggermente diverso):**
```
You're In The Right Place If...
```

**Copy (3 paragrafi):**
```
You're a post-seed or Series A founder. Your company does €1–15M in revenue.
Typically 15–80 people.

You can build. You can sell. The problem is that the company is growing
faster than its structure can handle.

You don't have a COO yet — or your Head of Ops is great but can't
redesign the whole machine. You need strategy and execution.
Then you need someone who leaves when it works.
```

---

### 5. THE 3S METHOD (framework proprietario)

**Headline (grande, centrato):**
```
How I Work — The 3S Method
```

**Intro:**
```
Most companies don't have a people problem. They have a structure problem.
Value leaks in the gaps between teams.
```

**Bold statement:**
```
I care about margin and execution. Not org chart aesthetics.
```

**Sub:**
```
Here's how I typically work with clients:
```

**3 card con pricing (bordo accent, sfondo scuro):**

**Card 1:**
```
Consultant COO
```
```
• Specific projects with a clear scope: org redesign, team restructuring, M&A integration
• I come in, solve the problem, and hand it back
• Full audit → prioritized action plan → hands-on execution
• For companies that need a fix, not a permanent hire
```

**Card 2:**
```
Fractional COO
```
```
• Ongoing operational leadership, 3–6 months
• I work alongside your team: redesign structure, install governance, drive execution
• Not advice — actual change
• For companies with product-market fit, ready to scale
```

**Card 3:**
```
Advisory
```
```
• Lighter touch for founders who need a sparring partner
• Regular check-ins to challenge your thinking
• Review your structure and keep you honest on execution
• Monthly workshop optional
```

> Nota: per ora SENZA prezzi sulle card. Li aggiungeremo dopo.

**Sotto le card:**
```
My role: I come in, make the hard calls nobody inside wants to make,
install the system, and leave when it works. I'm not part of your politics.
```

```
Not sure which fits? Book a call. We'll figure it out together.
```

**CTA:** [Book 20 Min] → Calendly

### 10. COMMON QUESTIONS (FAQ accordion)

**Headline:**
```
Common Questions
```

**Domande (accordion — click per espandere):**

```
Q: What if I already have a Head of Ops?
A: Great. I'm not here to replace them. I work at a structural level —
redesigning how the org works, clarifying ownership, and installing
governance. Your Head of Ops executes the plan. I design the machine.
```

```
Q: How much does this cost?
A: It depends on scope. Consultant COO is a fixed project.
Fractional COO is a monthly retainer. Advisory is lighter.
Book a call and I'll tell you honestly if it makes sense for your stage.
```

```
Q: What deliverables do I get?
A: In a Consultant COO engagement: a full audit with a prioritized action plan.
In a retainer: redesigned structure, governance frameworks, process maps,
KPI dashboards, and hands-on implementation support. Not slide decks —
actual change.
```

```
Q: How much time do I need to commit?
A: For a Consultant COO project, 3-4 hours of your time over 2 weeks.
For a retainer, a weekly sync + access to your team. I do the heavy
lifting. You make the final calls.
```

```
Q: Do you work remotely or in-person?
A: Primarily remote (EU timezone), with on-site visits when needed.
Based in Barcelona. Fluent in English, Italian, and Spanish.
```

```
Q: What about confidentiality?
A: Full NDA before we start. I've worked with sensitive M&A processes
and investor data. Confidentiality is non-negotiable.
```

```
Q: What if I'm not ready yet?
A: That's fine. The Consultant COO format exists exactly for this — it tells you
where you are and what to fix first. Sometimes the answer is
"not yet, but here's what to do in 3 months."
```

```
Q: How hands-on are you?
A: Very. I don't send frameworks and disappear. I sit with your team,
run the meetings, have the hard conversations, and stay until
the system holds without me.
```

```
Q: Why should I trust you over other fractional COOs?
A: I read the P&L and redesign the org. Most fractional COOs come
from pure ops. I have real financial training (Deloitte, EY) and
hands-on experience scaling teams in marketplace businesses.
When I say "I find where margin leaks," it's not a metaphor.
```

### 11. CTA FINALE (su sfondo accent pieno — verde scuro)

```
Get in touch — let's talk.
```

```
I'm currently accepting 2–3 clients for Q1 2026.
```

**CTA:** [book a 20 minutes call] → Calendly

```
We'll figure out if this makes sense. If it does, great. If it doesn't, I'll tell you.
```
